Example TODO Web Application

To run project you should simply type `mvn clean install jetty:run`
Then you can navigate to http://localhost:8080/todo/

TODO:
1. Input validation
2. Redirection to /todo path if it was not specified
3. Check for invalid password (do not create another user with the same username)
4. Style changes (currently there is "dummy" style, which looks terribly :))
